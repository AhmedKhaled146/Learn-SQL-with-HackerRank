= The ABCs of Database: 

Data Manipulation Language (DML): بعدل علي الداتا نفسها اللي عندي بعملها تعديل (بدخل داتا جديده - بمسح داتا موجوده اصلا - بعمل ابديت لداتا موجوده عندي )
At the heart of database operations lies DML, the language responsible for manipulating data within the database. DML commands facilitate data records' insertion, updating, deletion, and retrieval. Common examples include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements. DML essentially empowers us to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on our data, ensuring its integrity and relevance.

Data Definition Language (DDL): بعدل علي الاستراكشر نفسه بلعب فيه (ممكن اكريت تابل جديد - ممكن اعدل علي التابل دا اغير في الكولومز - ممكن امسح كولوم منه )
Contrary to DML's focus on data manipulation, DDL governs the structure and schema of the database itself. DDL commands enable the creation, alteration, and deletion of database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas. Examples of DDL statements include CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which shape the blueprint of our data environment. Mastering DDL ensures the foundation of our database aligns with organizational needs and evolving requirements.

Data Control Language (DCL):
Security and access control are paramount in any database ecosystem, and that's precisely where DCL comes into play. DCL commands grant or revoke permissions to users, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. With statements like GRANT and REVOKE, DCL empowers administrators to govern who can access specific data and what actions they can perform. By wielding DCL effectively, organizations fortify their data against unauthorized access and manipulation.

Data Transaction Language (DTL): 
In the realm of transaction management, DTL reigns supreme. DTL commands facilitate the management of transactions within a database, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties). Key DTL commands include BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK, which orchestrate the initiation, conclusion, and reversal of database transactions. Mastery of DTL guarantees the reliability and resilience of our data operations, even amidst complex transactional scenarios.

Data Query Language (DQL): 
Last but certainly not least, we encounter DQL, the language dedicated to querying data from the database. While SELECT statements fall under both DML and DQL categories, DQL emphasizes the retrieval and presentation of data rather than its manipulation. DQL enables us to formulate sophisticated queries to extract insights, generate reports, and drive decision-making processes. Proficiency in DQL empowers analysts and stakeholders to uncover valuable patterns and trends hidden within vast datasets.

# Create Database: 
    - CREATE DATABASE db_name;
        |= CREATE DATABASE School_system;

    - CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name;
        |= CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS School_system;

# Drop Database: 
    - DROP DATABASE db_name;
        |= DROP DATABASE School_system;

    - DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name;
        |= DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS School_system;

# Create tables:
    - CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name data_type, column_name data_type, ...);
        |= CREATE TABLE student (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(25), age INT);

# Drop tables:
    - DROP TABLE table_name;
        |= DROP TABLE student;

# Alter tables:
    - Add column to table:
        - ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name data_type, ...;
            |= ALTER TABLE student ADD address char(40);
    
    - Drop column from table:
        - ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
            |= ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN age;

    - UPDATE "table_name" SET age = "value"; ==> this will change all the records in the table with the same value.
        |= UPDATE student SET age = "25";

    - UPDATE "table_name" SET age = "value" WHERE age = "value" ==> this will change just the record have the name is value.
        |= UPDATE student SET age = "25" WHERE name = 'ahmed';


# Delete from the table:
    - DELETE FROM "table_name"; ==> this will delete all the records in the table.
        |= DELETE FROM student;

    - DELETE FROM "table_name WHERE age = "value"; ==> this will delete just the record have an age is value.
